<h1>Time Series (Course from Kaggle)</h1>

This repository contains my personal learning code from the **Kaggle – Time Series** course.

It serves as a collection of exercises, notes, and hands-on practice as I build a strong foundation in Python programming.

**Courses**
-----------

*   **Linear Regression With Time Series**: use two features unique to time series (lags and time steps)
*   **Trend**: model long-term changes with moving averages and the time dummy
*   **Seasonality**: create indicators and Fourier features to capture periodic change
*   **Time Series and Features**: predict the future from the past with a lag embedding
*   **Hybrid Models**: combine the strengths of two forecasters with this powerful technique
*   **Forecasting with Machine Learning**: apply ML to any forecasting task with these strategies
    
Each notebook contains exercises that reflect my step-by-step learning progress.

**Notes**
---------

This repo is mainly for:
*   Reviewing concepts I’ve learned
*   Practicing and experimenting with Python code
*   Building discipline in my coding journey
